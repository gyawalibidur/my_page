    <h2 class="japan">About Japan</h2>
    <p>Japan is an island country in East ASIA. Located in the Pacific Ocean,
      it lies off the eastern coast of the Asian continent and stretches from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and the Philippine Sea in the south.
      Archaeological research indicates that Japan was inhabited as early as the Upper Paleolithic period.
      The first written mention of Japan is in Chinese history texts from the 1st century AD.
       Influence from other regions, mainly China, followed by periods of isolation, particularly from Western Europe,
   has characterized Japan's history.

      located southwest of the main island of Honshu to which it is connected via two bridge systems.
      This island is also tied to influential monk Kobo Daishi as the home of the 88 Temple route, one of the country’s most important pilgrimages.
      Aside from attracting those seeking spiritual fulfilment, the island offers some spectacular coastlines, mountain ranges, and tumbling rivers.
